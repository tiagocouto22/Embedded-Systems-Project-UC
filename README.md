# Embedded-Systems-Project-UC
This project focuses on developing an embedded systems mobile robot for search and rescue in unknown environments. The robot will use distance sensors to avoid obstacles and an RFID detector to locate "victims" represented by RFID tags. It will report the positions of detected tags to a remote terminal.
